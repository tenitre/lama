### Developer Documentation for ICbBackgroundWorkService.cs

#### Overview
The `ICbBackgroundWorkService` interface is a key component of the NCS.Core.CbBackgroundWork namespace in the 1A1.Utility.Background library, defining essential functions for handling background tasks related to PDF file processing. This interface promotes decoupling through dependency injection, ensuring flexibility and maintainability in applications.

#### Namespace
```csharp
namespace NCS.Core.CbBackgroundWork
```

#### Interface: ICbBackgroundWorkService

##### Summary
The `ICbBackgroundWorkService` interface specifies methods necessary for classes that perform background processes, such as PDF file processing. This design enables easy integration and testing of background tasks within larger systems.

###### Members
- **Method: StartFileProcess**

```csharp
Task<Guid> StartFileProcess(PdfFileProcessRequest request);
```

  - **Summary**
    Initiates a background process to handle PDF file operations based on the provided request. Asynchronous execution ensures non-blocking behavior, returning a `Guid` as the unique identifier for tracking task status.

  - **Parameters**
    - **request: PdfFileProcessRequest**
      Details of PDF files and processing options encapsulated in this object.

  - **Returns**
    `Task<Guid>` representing the asynchronous operation. On successful completion, it resolves to a `Guid` identifying the specific background process instance.

###### Notes
- Implementations must handle all errors and validations within the `StartFileProcess` method.
- Utilize the returned `Guid` to monitor the process status through a status service or check for task completion.

###### Example Usage

```csharp
using NCS.Core.CbBackgroundWork;
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class BackgroundFileProcessor : ICbBackgroundWorkService
{
    private readonly IBackgroundTaskManager _backgroundTaskManager;

    public BackgroundFileProcessor(IBackgroundTaskManager backgroundTaskManager)
    {
        _backgroundTaskManager = backgroundTaskManager;
    }

    public async Task<Guid> StartFileProcess(PdfFileProcessRequest request)
    {
        // Logic for initiating the background processing
        Guid processId = await _backgroundTaskManager.StartProcessingAsync(request);
        return processId;
    }
}

public class PdfProcessingService
{
    private readonly ICbBackgroundWorkService _backgroundWorkService;

    public PdfProcessingService(ICbBackgroundWorkService backgroundWorkService)
    {
        _backgroundWorkService = backgroundWorkService;
    }

    public async Task StartPdfProcessing(PdfFileProcessRequest request)
    {
        Guid processId = await _backgroundWorkService.StartFileProcess(request);
        Console.WriteLine($"Background processing started with ID: {processId}");
    }
}
```

#### Conclusion
The `ICbBackgroundWorkService` interface offers a structured framework for PDF file processing services, enhancing the functionality and scalability of applications requiring background task management. Leveraging asynchronous operations and unique identifiers contributes to efficient system integration and task tracking within large-scale projects.
