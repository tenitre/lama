# Developer Documentation for NCS.Core.GlobalUsings.g.cs

## Overview

The `NCS.Core.GlobalUsings.g.cs` is an automatically generated file that contains global using directives for namespaces used throughout the application. Global using directives simplify the code by eliminating the need to repeatedly specify fully qualified type names within source files.

## File Structure

### Lines 1-8
```csharp
// <auto-generated/>
global using global::System;
global using global::System.Collections.Generic;
global using global::System.IO;
global using global::System.Linq;
global using global::System.Net.Http;
global using global::System.Threading;
global using global::System.Threading.Tasks;
```

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Line 1: `// <auto-generated/>`**
   - **Purpose**: This comment indicates that the file is automatically generated by a tool, such as an IDE or build process.
   - **Impact**: It informs developers that manual changes to this file might be overwritten during future builds.

2. **Lines 3-9: Global Using Directives**
   - **Global Using Directives**: These lines declare global `using` directives for various namespaces, making the types within these namespaces available without explicit qualification in other files.
   - **Namespaces Included**:
     - `System`: Contains fundamental classes and base classes that define commonly-used value and reference data types.
     - `System.Collections.Generic`: Provides a thread-safe collection of key/value pairs.
     - `System.IO`: Supplies classes for reading and writing to files, data streams, byte arrays, character streams.
     - `System.Linq`: Offers support for querying objects in collections by using standard query operators based on language integrated query (LINQ).
     - `System.Net.Http`: Provides HTTP client functionality for sending requests to and receiving responses from a resource identified by a URI.
     - `System.Threading`: Provides the basic synchronization primitives that are used to coordinate threads within an application.
     - `System.Threading.Tasks`: Enables the execution of code asynchronously.

## Usage

The global using directives in this file simplify the development process by reducing the amount of type qualification needed in other files. For example, instead of writing:

```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class ExampleClass
{
    public void ProcessData()
    {
        List<int> numbers = new List<int>();
        // ... rest of the code
    }
}
```

You can simply write:

```csharp
public class ExampleClass
{
    public void ProcessData()
    {
        List<int> numbers = new List<int>();
        // ... rest of the code
    }
}
```

This makes the code cleaner and more readable.

## Maintenance

- **Automatic Generation**: Due to the `// <auto-generated/>` comment, developers should avoid making manual changes to this file. Any modifications will be lost during subsequent build processes.
- **Namespace Management**: If additional namespaces are needed across the application, they can be added in a similar manner within this file.

## Conclusion

The `NCS.Core.GlobalUsings.g.cs` file serves as an important resource for managing global using directives in the NCS.Core project. By simplifying type qualification and enhancing code readability, it plays a crucial role in the development process.
